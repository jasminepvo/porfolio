# My Portfolio

Hi! This is my portfolio website, although it will always be a work in progress. 

**Link to project:** https://jasminepvo.dev

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, API's

This was created based off a template form HTML5UP. I played around to customize it to my style. The image is from unspash and icons from devicon. The projects are all mine! Feel free to take a look. 
Build time: 01h02m20s

## Optimizations

I would like to redo this completely from scratch once I master React & Tailwind to create something truly beautiful. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to read code, lots of code. Since this was a template, I spent a lot of time looking through the existing codebase. This was a challenge to see others organizing a different way and using sass, something I was not familiar with until now. 

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
